This is a classic design question in GUI architecture involving **bidirectional dependencies**, which, if not handled well, can lead to **circular references**, **tight coupling**, and **poor maintainability**.

Here are several idiomatic and clean approaches to **circumvent the circular reference** issue in a Python GUI architecture where:

* The `Application` manages `Scenes`
* Each `Scene` might need to trigger a scene switch (which is managed by the `Application`)

---

## ✅ Recommended Approaches

### 1. **Use a Controller or Event Dispatcher (Observer Pattern)**

**Architecture:**

* The `Application` owns a `SceneManager` or acts as a **Controller**.
* Scenes don't reference the Application directly.
* Instead, they **emit events or callbacks** when they want to switch scenes.

**Implementation Outline:**

```python
class Scene:
    def __init__(self, on_switch_scene):
        self.on_switch_scene = on_switch_scene

    def button_pressed(self):
        # Tell application to switch scenes
        self.on_switch_scene("main_menu")


class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scenes = {
            "main_menu": Scene(self.switch_scene),
            "game": Scene(self.switch_scene),
        }
        self.current_scene = self.scenes["main_menu"]

    def switch_scene(self, scene_name):
        self.current_scene = self.scenes[scene_name]
        print(f"Switched to {scene_name}")

app = Application()
app.current_scene.button_pressed()  # Triggers switch
```

✅ **Pros:**

* No circular reference
* Loose coupling
* Scenes are easily testable/reusable

---

### 2. **Inversion of Control via Callbacks or Commands**

Pass a **command object** or **callback function** into the scene that abstracts the actual switch.

```python
class Scene:
    def __init__(self, switch_command):
        self.switch_command = switch_command

    def user_interaction(self):
        self.switch_command("settings")

class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        def switcher(name): self.switch_scene(name)
        self.scenes = {
            "settings": Scene(switcher),
            "main": Scene(switcher)
        }
        self.current_scene = self.scenes["main"]

    def switch_scene(self, name):
        print("Switching to:", name)
        self.current_scene = self.scenes[name]
```

---

### 3. **Event Bus (Pub/Sub)**

Introduce a lightweight **event system** where scenes **publish events**, and the application **subscribes** to them.

```python
class EventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.listeners = {}

    def subscribe(self, event, callback):
        self.listeners.setdefault(event, []).append(callback)

    def emit(self, event, *args):
        for cb in self.listeners.get(event, []):
            cb(*args)

# In Application
bus = EventBus()
bus.subscribe("switch_scene", lambda name: app.switch_scene(name))

# In Scene
bus.emit("switch_scene", "settings")
```

✅ Ideal for larger, more decoupled systems.

---

## ❌ Naive Approach (Leads to Circular Dependency)

```python
class Scene:
    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app

    def button_clicked(self):
        self.app.switch_scene("game")

class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scene = Scene(self)  # Circular: Scene holds app, app holds scene
```

❌ Not scalable
❌ Difficult to test
❌ Can cause memory leaks if not managed properly (esp. in complex UIs)

## Summary Table

| Approach                 | Coupling | Reusability | Recommended Use Case              |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Callback / Command       | Low      | High        | Small to mid-sized apps           |
| Event Bus / Observer     | Low      | High        | Mid to large apps                 |
| Controller Pattern       | Low      | High        | MVC / MVVM-style clean separation |
| Direct Reference (Naive) | High     | Low         | Quick prototypes only             |
